## Scrum

Scrum is one of the methodologies under the Agile umbrella. 
The practice revolves around 
- A set of roles (delivery team, product owner, and scrum master)
- Ceremonies (sprint planning, daily standup, sprint review, sprint retrospective, and backlog grooming)
- Artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog, product increment, and info radiators and reports).
- The main goal is to keep the team aligned on project progress to facilitate rapid iteration.
- Many organisations have opted for Scrum, because unlike the Waterfall model, it ensures a deliverable at the end of each Sprint.

## Artifacts
- Sprint: It is the time duration, mostly in weeks, for which a Team works to achieve or create a deliverable. A deliverable can defined as a piece of code of fragment of the Final Product which the team wants o achieve. Scrum advises to keep the duration of a Sprint between 2-4 weeks.
- Product Backlog: It is the list of tasks a Team is supposed to finish within the current Sprint. It is decided by the Product Owner, in agreement with the Management as well as Delivery Team.

## Roles
- Product Owner(PO): The ONLY Accountable person to the Management. PO decides what goes in or out of the Product Backlog.
- Delivery Team: They are required to work in accordance with the tasks set by their PO in the product backlog and deliver the required delivarable at the end of the sprint.
- Scrum Masters: - Scrum Master's has to strictly adhere to Scrum Guide and make the team understand the need to adhere to Scrum guide when following Scrum. It is a Scrum Master's job to ensure all Scrum ceremonies being conducted on time and participated by all the required people as per the scrum guide. The SM has to ensure that the Daily Scrum is conducted regularly and actively participated by the team.
